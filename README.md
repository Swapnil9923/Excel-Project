# Excel-Project


**Dairy Products performance   Analysis**


The goal of this project is to analyze dairy product data to determine how various items are doing in terms of revenue, stock, and sales. Location, total land area, cow count, farm size, product specifications (name, brand, price, quantity), storage conditions, production and expiration dates, sales numbers, and stock levels are all included in the collection. This project's objectives were to clean up the data, add missing numbers, extract insights using Excel functions, and then build a straightforward dashboard that compiled the results. It's a useful exercise that demonstrates my proficiency in Excel data analysis.

1. **Data Cleaning**

   I cleaned up the dataset as my initial task. A few entries were missing, some formatting problems existed, and some duplicates required to be handled. To make everything consistent
   I standardized the names of the brands, items, and places. I also corrected any formatting issues with the dates. In order to ensure that the data was prepared for analysis.

3. **Imputing Data**

   I then completed the data's gaps. For instance, there were missing data in certain columns, such as revenue and product quantities. To estimate these values, I used the rest of the data's averages or trends.
   I used the manufacture dates and shelf life to calculate expiration dates in cases where they were absent. This made the dataset more accurate and comprehensive.

5. **Utilizing Advanced Functions and Excel Aggregation**

   I gathered important data using Excel's built-in functions, such as SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, and COUNTIFS.as total sales separated by product and location. Advanced features such as VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH aided in 
   matching and retrieving data from various sections of the data. I was able to determine factors like profit margins, stock reorder levels, and overall sales performance with the help of these Functions.

6. **Building a Basic Dashboard**

   In the end, I made a simple dashboard to display the outcomes. I presented significant data, such as total revenue per product, stock levels at various locations, and significant sales trends, using pivot 
   tables and charts. It's simple to observe which products are selling well, which places require extra stock, and where enhancements may be made thanks to the dashboard.



This project showcases my abilities to handle and clean data, using Excel to do insightful analysis, and design a simple, clear dashboard.Dairy Goods
